Iteration 1 Instructions:

Visit http://limitless-scrubland-2940.herokuapp.com/editor.html to edit the stage. You must place a minimum of one start-element and one goal-element. Make sure that the start block rests on top of a block-element, or the user-sprite will fall to their bottom-less death.

Once done, hit 'Render!' and then hit 'Play Stage!'.

A default stage can be played at http://limitless-scrubland-2940.herokuapp.com/game/game.html.
