Our application is live at http://platformdesignmadness.herokuapp.com/ , which includes a stage editor and stage player. 

From the homepage, you can click 'Log In or Register' to create an account and start creating stages. 

Logging in takes you to your user profile page. The profile page displays the default stage, recently-created stages, and your saved stages. Each saved stage has an option to edit it or play it.
